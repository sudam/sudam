### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Sudam

I was born and raised in Sri Lanka, currently living in New Zealand. I've been working for several companies developing enterprise applications for quality assuarance, travel and retail industries. I have a bachelor's degree in Computing and Information Systems.

I am a full stack software developer centered on Microsoft's .NET Framework. Often work with C#, ASP.NET, SQL Server & EF6, Node JS, React JS, HTML5, CSS, JavaScript (ES6), jQuery etc.

Love to create solutions keeping user experience in mind.
